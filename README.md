# FogBus
## Abstract
The intention of facilitating simultaneous execution for both latency sensitive and computing intensive Internet of Things (IoT)
applications is consistently boosting the necessity of integrating Edge, Fog and Cloud infrastructure. There exists a notable number
of real-world frameworks for attaining such integration. However, the limitations of existing frameworks in terms of platform
independence, security, resource management and multi-application assistance resist the potentiality of integrated environment.
Therefore, in this paper, we developed a simplified but effective framework, named FogBus for implementing end-to-end IoTFog(
Edge)-Cloud integration. FogBus offers a platform independent interface to IoT applications and computing instances for
execution and interaction. It not only assists developers in building up applications but also supports users in running multiple
applications at a time and service providers to manage their resources. In addition, FogBus applies Blockchain, authentication and
encryption techniques to secure operations on sensitive data. Besides, it is easy to deploy, scalable, energy and cost efficient. To
demonstrate the efficacy, we also designed a prototype for Sleep Apnea analysis through FogBus framework. The experimental
results of this case study show that different FogBus settings can improve latency, energy, network and CPU usage of the computing
infrastructure.

## About the work
The major contributions of this work are listed as:
 * A lightweight and simplified framework named FogBus
that integrates IoT enabled systems, Fog and Cloud infrastructure
and harness both edge and remote resources
according to application requirements.
 * Exploration of platform independent application execution
and node-to-node interaction overcoming heterogeneity
within the integrated environment.
 * Design of a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) model that assists
application developers, users and service providers to
pursue individual interests.
 * Development of a prototype for Sleep Apnea analysis in
integrated IoT-Fog-Cloud environment.
 * Implementation of block chain technique to ensure data
integrity while transferring confidential data.
 * Performance evaluation of FogBus in terms of latency, energy,
network and CPU usage.
